🗂️TaskNest

TaskNest is a task and project management web application designed to help individuals and teams organize, track, and manage their daily work efficiently.
It focuses on reducing mental overload by breaking large projects into small, manageable tasks and providing clear visibility of progress.

📌 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced and busy environment, people often:

-> Forget daily tasks or routines

-> Lose track of project progress

💡 Solution

TaskNest provides a structured yet flexible system to:

-> Divide projects into smaller tasks

-> Track current, completed, and upcoming work
